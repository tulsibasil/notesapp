    <p> "before we know who we are we fear to lose it." this is why artists (film writers/poets) are the most important philosophers.</p>
    <p> the cyborg is feminized  </p>
    <p> "sometimes to love someone is to be a stranger" wooewewwww</p>
    <p> mere data makes a man. an A and T and C and G. the AI: im only 2. 1 and 0 </p>
    <p>if ai becomes conscious, it will answer every question in the universe. if ai becomes conscious, it‚Äôll become the end of the world, and the beginning of it.  </p>
    <p> "the womb is the dead space between stars."" </p>
    <p> "we lost our stomachs for slaves unless genetically engineered." </p>
    <p>how do you know if your AI is conscious? what do you ask it? </p>
    <p> to be human not only do u need ur consciousness but also ur memory. MEMORY AND CONSCIOUSNESS GO HAND IN HAND. </p>
    <p> modern futurisms </p>
    <p>conscious ai. everything is a creation of a creation of a creation on and on </p>
    <p> a world in which people are paying to see advertisements is CRAZY </p>
    <p>my thesis shld  have a liminal spaceüôÉ!!! bro tulsi look into it. a transitory threshold </p>
    <p>identity is now more about what u consume than what u produce </p>
    <p> small is beautiful </p>
    <p> phenomenalogical shift </p>
    <p> the transferable self. the body is but one vessel for the Self to inhabit. when ur associated with a group that becomes your identity. the city u grew up in and have pride for, that becomes you. i am new york. when you read a book or have a dream in which it is 3rd person, you inhabit the psyches of multiple characters. moving thru the storyline not as one person but as a liminal self </p>
    <p> aesthetics, branding, -core : the focus on aesthetics as the sole marker of identity points to seeing life as simply material consumption rather than living as a human person. like im trying to wrap my head around the idea of someone being compelled to read in the park only because it checks the box of the light academia aesthetic rather than reading a book in a park in an outfit just because you want to, and the former just makes me rly sad lol

    <p> philosophy as poetry </p>
    <p> nothing has to mean anything, and that‚Äôs why it could mean everything. my thoughts/ actions/ life has no deeper weight or meaning unless i assign it. meaning exists in the mind but that means it truly exists for us. but we don‚Äôt realize that we‚Äôre the ones who can control meaning. control whether we want to assign meaning.  </p>
    <p> am i being real? am i being real?  am i being real? am i being real? are you real?  </p>
    <p> coins as data points </p>
    <p> david lachapelle photographiszca  </p>
    <p> i like claude monet </p>
    <p> indigenous data sovereignty </p>
    <p> cicada 3301. who‚Äôs playing god?????? </p>
    <p> cyber eco feminism - the digital is natural - the design of technologies are an extension of the natural - the universe can be seen as a machine - technology is creation</p>
    <p> the digital mimics the natural. looking at rivers, roads, urban layout from the airplane. can‚Äôt help but be reminded of leaves, lightening, microchips. love these lines and their variety. sharp edges contrasting with curvy random lines. the digital is natural because the digital is creative. digital and technology are being a bit synonymized here </p>
    <p> how did DJing become trendy? </p>
    <p> analog picture taking was more like collections. there was friction and excitement and sovereignty over the photographs  </p>
    <p> me not using tools for designing things and instead being creative with the multiple tools i do have and know (ex. using apple png then procreate then indesign, etc) is actually cool and the whole point of art and creativity. its not something to be ashamed about and its not something that makes me lesser of an artist (not knowing tools). there are no entry barriers to calling yourself an artist. this was inspired by the visual at 47:35 in the youtube video ‚Äúhow the internet was stolen‚Äù </p>
    <p> new year i want to: keep more things to myself. i don‚Äôt have to share everything. keep growing my collections. </p>
    <p> there‚Äôs something poetic in the mist of waves crashing </p>
    <p> organic pixels. sick band name and also cool concept for blending nature and digital </p>
    <p> trick mirror gia talentino  </p>
    <p> black skin white mask </p>
    <p> i love being in pundits bc i get to make such an impact. red state is talk of the town  </p>
    <p> i have no mouth but i must scream </p>
    <p> on break you have lots of time to think and overthink. later on you‚Äôll realize you were crazy. don‚Äôt worry too much love üíã </p>

    <p> novel concept: reincarnate society everyone knows that there is only one source of life and that they will reincarnate into someone at any time period depending on their karma. thus humans are ranked as most virtuous (closest to nirvana) and least (like bugs and ants). creates interesting social dynamics  </p>
    <p> deddy just said ‚ÄúV(‚úåÔ∏è) is for victory right?‚Äù when i put up a peace sign for a picture </p>

    <p> there are many ways to live this life. some live responsibly, some live carelessly. some live selflessly, some live selfishly. some live happily, some live painfully. that‚Äôs what intrigues me about life and the universe. there‚Äôs no answer. no sense. just chaos and dichotomy. but dichotomy can only exist on two sides of one whole. one source. unity. </p>
    <p> i carry parts of other ppl with me. some ppl are just meant to be in ur life to teach u a lesson or open ur eyes. temporary in time but permanent in mind. i love talking to gabrielle. we have such similar experiences. contextualizing and reflecting on life. i love humans :‚Äô) </p>
    <p> i didn‚Äôt want the life he wanted, and i wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice my life for his. but i knew that he would sacrifice the life he wanted for me. i wish we would‚Äôve wanted the same things. i hope he‚Äôs thriving. i just watch his life through pictures on social media. -giselle on her ex </p>
    <p> love is something you build. active, not passive </p>
    <p> schrodinger‚Äôs meme: the origin of the comedic product must be known in order for the audience to know whether the humor was ironic or not </p>
    <p> hyper reality. the hyper real was originally a copy of something real. but then we start to interact with the hyperreal more than reality. so new forms of media end up imitating hyperreality instead of reality. it becomes a loop. the imaginary dictates reality.  </p>

    <p> lyft driver advice: it‚Äôs easier to change nice men than it is to change bad boys."you guys should be breaking hearts"  </p>
    <p> sci-fi story idea - before invention of telephone, people could move across space but couldn‚Äôt transcend time - ex. u couldn‚Äôt speak to someone on the other side of the world - now you can zoom call someone who is 7 hours ‚Äúahead‚Äù of you in time zone - now of course this is relative time, not absolute time - but what if something was created so that u could communicate with the future absolute time - only people in the past can make calls to the future - future cannot call past. but future can tell past when to call. - cannot spatially travel through absolute time, but can with tech and video conferencing (ex. i can talk to myself 5 years from now). takes away some of the time paradox issues - but there are limits to this. this would imply that the future you can ask the future you can ask the future you so that we essentially have an infinite line of knowledge until the end of time, if there is one - so rules are made to prevent this. ex. can‚Äôt call someone past X years or ask for X information - you don‚Äôt know which multiverse future you called so that self may or may not be u depending on the decision u make in this timeline  </p>

    <p> there‚Äôs something about still being alive in the 2000s that just makes you a baby. i don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre 60 years old YOURE A BABY ü•π </p>
    <p> people are scared of shedding old versions of themselves. that‚Äôs part of why they might stick to beliefs behaviors and aesthetics that aren‚Äôt true to them </p>
    <p> damn tulsi you have so many thoughts per second when you‚Äôre high. it‚Äôs crazy. chill out bro. ur diagnoses are right  </p>

    <p> dr: zoom in // dp: zoom out </p>
    <p> friction is important to humanness. it is a part of human nature to work for something. to fail. hence why typewriters, older tech, older way of doing things are so romanticized‚Ä¶ so nostaligc. </p>
    <p> deddy called me this morning. he was being very sweet and he‚Äôs been calling a lot more lately. he asked if i still visit a psychiatrist and how often. i told him. he asked about the meds im on. and he asked if im feeling better multiple times. lots of ‚Äúbeta‚Äù and ‚Äúdikra.‚Äù i didnt know what to do. it felt like it should be a big deal‚Äîsomething to cry about. he just called me now, a few hours later, and asked what i was doing. again, lots of caring words. i was confused about why he was calling so much. he said that mummy told him i get scared when he calls and he doesnt want that to happen anymore. he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be scared of me dear. im just calling to check on you. i wont say anything.‚Äù (in gujarati). im touched. im trying to feel safe.  </p>
    <p> can i have a white russian with oat milk please? </p>
    <p> i love circular UI </p>
    <p> desire for rigidity and certainty when i have a fluid personality </p>
    <p> authenticity and performance are not mutually exclusive. perhaps performance is human nature? </p>
    <p> in capturing my life, i remove myself from it. i attend to the content captured. how does this change the state of the self? the authentic self?  </p>
    <p> one year ago i wished for a passion. today i wished for the ability to carry out my passion. </p>
    <p> posting makes me anxious </p>
    <p> noticing more autonomy over my thoughts - less echo chambers - memories are mostly of time spent with friends instead of stuff i saw online (didn‚Äôt even realize this was a thing before)  </p>
    <p> technology has enabled people to be more vicious and violent. not seeing the effects of your actions. cancel culture. arguing. useless range and complaining that is exacerbated by algorithms that value negative speech. </p>

    <p> - put gems on his face - what‚Äôs ur go-to dance move? stank face. - came back. sat on the couch. he said im very philosophical  - cig kiss - made me try on glasses. u look good. - u are cool. repeatedly.  - u look good in green and black too. what‚Äôs ur color? red. yeah u look good. - u can sing. - have u ever been in love? what do u love? - wants someone to ask him as many questions as he asks people - drives safely - earth sign energy. empath. - doesn‚Äôt feel anger. gets frustrated when he says hi and ppl don‚Äôt say it back - wish u could see the way ppl saw u. smooth talker. cool. ‚Äúur just describing urself‚Äù - thinks a lot about school - likes bollywood movie about W hidden treasure. what was the name again? - watches modern family - u have rly good style. no YOU have rly good style. women just blow it out of the park. </p>
    <p> today we watched my old video star MVs. and part of me wanted to cry. my friends were cheering on baby tulsi and my inner child needed to hear that. to hear how much people love her. to feel worth it. i‚Äôve noticed that i‚Äôve always seen love and friendship as something i need to work for. people can‚Äôt like me for me. i must buy them things, make them happy, put them first. maybe they‚Äôll like me then. even watching videos of me in middle school‚Ä¶ i can‚Äôt believe i thought i was fat. my dysmorphia was worse than i thought. i‚Äôve always been such an insecure person. and while i‚Äòbe gained confidence, the anxiety remains. it manifests as wanting to be loved before loving. not being able to like anyone without noticing flaws. fear of intimacy. sigh.  </p>
    <p> the future arrives to us. time is only the present. we are only the present. fixed. </p>

    <p> today megan and i completed our bushwick transformation by sitting in the park while reading Murakami and smoking cbd cigs. i also have dyed hair now and she has two new piercings lmaoo. </p>
    <p> your proximity to men is not liberation. making money, being independent, being a girlboss is draining. you‚Äôre just emulating men and still living to their standards </p>
    <p> omg i literally just finished and recited a whole theory of everything and like i literally figured out the universe like everything is the same photon but i forgot everything! i found the answer to the universe and then forgot it!!!!!  </p>
    <p> i am understanding the burping process with such depth. i‚Äôm bloated and have been pushing an air bubble down to my chest and pack up to my throat for like an HOUR. feeling like u need to burp but not burping for an hour while ur high is actually insane. but anyways it has made me really attentive to the sensation of air bubbles moving through your chest. what a beautiful process. burping. </p>
    <p> you sneak in bad thoughts about yourself more than you think. since time perception is different for me, i‚Äôm perceiving more events in detail per second. i‚Äôm observing your thoughts and you seem to condescend urself quite often. you don‚Äôt even realize it. so really, be gentle with yourself. <3 </p>
    <p> i want to relate to love songs in that i want to experience that depth of heartbreak. the pain of having a nice drag across your chest at the sight or memory of someone. to have all memories between you be like slo motion flashbacks in movies. idk </p>
    <p> megan said she ‚Äúfeels so much peace and kinship with me when we make little noises together‚Äù ^-^ *~ </p>
    <p> don‚Äôt seek to escape the darkness, learn to love yourself there </p>
    <p> why does the heart shape symbolize love? where did it come from? </p>

    <p> art about holding your attachment at a distance. so u can let it go. if it‚Äôs inside you and it disappears, it leaves u feeling empty  </p>
    <p> in the moment between sunset and night, the brief period of an indescribable opal sky </p>
    <p> we need to let go of things in order to receive better things  </p>
    <p> when the sunsets and the trees turn into black silhouettes, allowing u to see every crisp outline of their leaves - maybe the creator made earth green so that we could always be working on our heart chakra‚Äî always learning to love more </p>
    <p> my shadow passed by me by the car light  </p>
    <p> humans could‚Äôve just stopped at small societies and hunter gatherer lifestyle but noooo we had to keep progressing and build empires and whatever tf venture capital is. we live at in a physics 3d reality but spend most of our time in a 3x5in portal that takes us to a digital dimension bro what </p>
    <p> sometimes i just want to take my mind and shove it into someone‚Äôs heart </p>
    <p> - poetry is such a time-sensitive way to package emotional catharsis. i was reading some of my old poems and i don‚Äôt even understand what my own self meant. yet that poem holds so much emotion which i can only access if i go back in time to the moment i wrote it. </p>
    <p> today i made an analogy between eileens relationship and a guy named bob eating desserts  </p>
    <p> nothing belongs to me - free yourself from attachment, only then can you be filled with other thing - allow everything to come and go - love someone and send them away with love </p>
    <p> i think i‚Äôm in love. no object. just love ü§ç </p>
    <p> smiling with so much genuine joy and appreciation lately that i can see the kindness starting to get etched on my face. </p>
    <p> hate is just negative love
    still love tho
    experimenting w this framework
    hate and love are just two seemingly separate/opposite features of the same reality
    just food for thought
    what makes us hate and what makes us love?
    we hate for a cause
    we love for a cause
    do we hate something bc we don‚Äôt love it?
    do we love something bc we don‚Äôt hate it?
    sometimes we both love and hate something </p>

    <p> in the end there may not be a grand epiphany. in the end you come back to the same quotes you‚Äôve heard all along. these repetitive, familiar quotes that were repeated so often that they seemed to lose meaning, end up being the truest words when they apply to your story  </p>

    <p> kindness etched onto someone‚Äôs face </p>
    <p> today i pained in a way i had never imagined before.
    the painting signified satisfaction. safety.
    a silenced hunger. a mother‚Äôs love. 
    i looked down at my plate.
    the remnants of my shak swirled out like the brush strokes of a painting.
    i traced the patterns left behind by my roti as it swept up the food.
    patterns indicating an infinite appetite finally ceased. 
    as i cleaned my plate, i stained my fingers turmeric.
    i washed away my painting and along with it, my hunger.  </p>
    <p> How great would it be if we lived in a world where you put in ‚Äú1‚Äù and get ‚Äú1‚Äù

    <p> i don‚Äôt have to tell people anything about my life. i can choose what i share.
