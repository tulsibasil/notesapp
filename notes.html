    <p> "before we know who we are we fear to lose it." this is why artists (film writers/poets) are the most important philosophers.</p>
    <p> the cyborg is feminized  </p>
    <p> "sometimes to love someone is to be a stranger" wooewewwww</p>
    <p> mere data makes a man. an A and T and C and G. the AI: im only 2. 1 and 0 </p>
    <p>if ai becomes conscious, it will answer every question in the universe. if ai becomes conscious, it’ll become the end of the world, and the beginning of it.  </p>
    <p> "the womb is the dead space between stars."" </p>
    <p> "we lost our stomachs for slaves unless genetically engineered." </p>
    <p>how do you know if your AI is conscious? what do you ask it? </p>
    <p> to be human not only do u need ur consciousness but also ur memory. MEMORY AND CONSCIOUSNESS GO HAND IN HAND. </p>
    <p> modern futurisms </p>
    <p>conscious ai. everything is a creation of a creation of a creation on and on </p>
    <p> a world in which people are paying to see advertisements is CRAZY </p>
    <p>my thesis shld  have a liminal space🙃!!! bro tulsi look into it. a transitory threshold </p>
    <p>identity is now more about what u consume than what u produce </p>
    <p> small is beautiful </p>
    <p> phenomenalogical shift </p>
    <p> the transferable self. the body is but one vessel for the Self to inhabit. when ur associated with a group that becomes your identity. the city u grew up in and have pride for, that becomes you. i am new york. when you read a book or have a dream in which it is 3rd person, you inhabit the psyches of multiple characters. moving thru the storyline not as one person but as a liminal self </p>
    <p> aesthetics, branding, -core : the focus on aesthetics as the sole marker of identity points to seeing life as simply material consumption rather than living as a human person. like im trying to wrap my head around the idea of someone being compelled to read in the park only because it checks the box of the light academia aesthetic rather than reading a book in a park in an outfit just because you want to, and the former just makes me rly sad lol

    <p> philosophy as poetry </p>
    <p> nothing has to mean anything, and that’s why it could mean everything. my thoughts/ actions/ life has no deeper weight or meaning unless i assign it. meaning exists in the mind but that means it truly exists for us. but we don’t realize that we’re the ones who can control meaning. control whether we want to assign meaning.  </p>
    <p> am i being real? am i being real?  am i being real? am i being real? are you real?  </p>
    <p> coins as data points </p>
    <p> david lachapelle photographiszca  </p>
    <p> i like claude monet </p>
    <p> indigenous data sovereignty </p>
    <p> cicada 3301. who’s playing god?????? </p>
    <p> cyber eco feminism - the digital is natural - the design of technologies are an extension of the natural - the universe can be seen as a machine - technology is creation</p>
    <p> the digital mimics the natural. looking at rivers, roads, urban layout from the airplane. can’t help but be reminded of leaves, lightening, microchips. love these lines and their variety. sharp edges contrasting with curvy random lines. the digital is natural because the digital is creative. digital and technology are being a bit synonymized here </p>
    <p> how did DJing become trendy? </p>
    <p> analog picture taking was more like collections. there was friction and excitement and sovereignty over the photographs  </p>
    <p> me not using tools for designing things and instead being creative with the multiple tools i do have and know (ex. using apple png then procreate then indesign, etc) is actually cool and the whole point of art and creativity. its not something to be ashamed about and its not something that makes me lesser of an artist (not knowing tools). there are no entry barriers to calling yourself an artist. this was inspired by the visual at 47:35 in the youtube video “how the internet was stolen” </p>
    <p> new year i want to: keep more things to myself. i don’t have to share everything. keep growing my collections. </p>
    <p> there’s something poetic in the mist of waves crashing </p>
    <p> organic pixels. sick band name and also cool concept for blending nature and digital </p>
    <p> trick mirror gia talentino  </p>
    <p> black skin white mask </p>
    <p> i love being in pundits bc i get to make such an impact. red state is talk of the town  </p>
    <p> i have no mouth but i must scream </p>
    <p> on break you have lots of time to think and overthink. later on you’ll realize you were crazy. don’t worry too much love 💋 </p>

    <p> novel concept: reincarnate society everyone knows that there is only one source of life and that they will reincarnate into someone at any time period depending on their karma. thus humans are ranked as most virtuous (closest to nirvana) and least (like bugs and ants). creates interesting social dynamics  </p>
    <p> deddy just said “V(✌️) is for victory right?” when i put up a peace sign for a picture </p>

    <p> there are many ways to live this life. some live responsibly, some live carelessly. some live selflessly, some live selfishly. some live happily, some live painfully. that’s what intrigues me about life and the universe. there’s no answer. no sense. just chaos and dichotomy. but dichotomy can only exist on two sides of one whole. one source. unity. </p>
    <p> i carry parts of other ppl with me. some ppl are just meant to be in ur life to teach u a lesson or open ur eyes. temporary in time but permanent in mind. i love talking to gabrielle. we have such similar experiences. contextualizing and reflecting on life. i love humans :’) </p>
    <p> i didn’t want the life he wanted, and i wouldn’t sacrifice my life for his. but i knew that he would sacrifice the life he wanted for me. i wish we would’ve wanted the same things. i hope he’s thriving. i just watch his life through pictures on social media. -giselle on her ex </p>
    <p> love is something you build. active, not passive </p>
    <p> schrodinger’s meme: the origin of the comedic product must be known in order for the audience to know whether the humor was ironic or not </p>
    <p> hyper reality. the hyper real was originally a copy of something real. but then we start to interact with the hyperreal more than reality. so new forms of media end up imitating hyperreality instead of reality. it becomes a loop. the imaginary dictates reality.  </p>
    <p> history of you </p>
    <p> the beauty of error— glitch. also language errors can be artistic </p>
    <p> life is not fair but the universe is balanced  </p>
    <p> lyft driver advice: it’s easier to change nice men than it is to change bad boys."you guys should be breaking hearts"  </p>
    <p> sci-fi story idea - before invention of telephone, people could move across space but couldn’t transcend time - ex. u couldn’t speak to someone on the other side of the world - now you can zoom call someone who is 7 hours “ahead” of you in time zone - now of course this is relative time, not absolute time - but what if something was created so that u could communicate with the future absolute time - only people in the past can make calls to the future - future cannot call past. but future can tell past when to call. - cannot spatially travel through absolute time, but can with tech and video conferencing (ex. i can talk to myself 5 years from now). takes away some of the time paradox issues - but there are limits to this. this would imply that the future you can ask the future you can ask the future you so that we essentially have an infinite line of knowledge until the end of time, if there is one - so rules are made to prevent this. ex. can’t call someone past X years or ask for X information - you don’t know which multiverse future you called so that self may or may not be u depending on the decision u make in this timeline  </p>
    <p> 가볍게 살자, 마음이 이미 무거워서… 생각도 많이 깊어서 </p>
    <p> MAKE IT STOP </p>
    <p> duniya me enough dukh che ke zindagi me jetlu bhi cry karo na enough nahi hoi — mummy </p>
    <p> create art influenced by nature and tech — circuitry, patterns, fractals. music production??? ecoscape + glitch core </p>
    <p> there’s something about still being alive in the 2000s that just makes you a baby. i don’t care if you’re 60 years old YOURE A BABY 🥹 </p>
    <p> people are scared of shedding old versions of themselves. that’s part of why they might stick to beliefs behaviors and aesthetics that aren’t true to them </p>
    <p> damn tulsi you have so many thoughts per second when you’re high. it’s crazy. chill out bro. ur diagnoses are right  </p>
    <p> ~ we’re stretching the amount of time we have together by being high ~ </p>
    <p> don ate a mango and said “this is gonna sound corny…. but i can literally see the tropics” </p>
    <p> Psithurism: sound of wind whispering through trees </p>
    <p> i wonder who participated in covid test trials bc a lot of the black women i know were in isolation much longer than most people </p>
    <p> artists can create something from nothing </p>
    <p> dr: zoom in // dp: zoom out </p>
    <p> friction is important to humanness. it is a part of human nature to work for something. to fail. hence why typewriters, older tech, older way of doing things are so romanticized… so nostaligc. </p>
    <p> deddy called me this morning. he was being very sweet and he’s been calling a lot more lately. he asked if i still visit a psychiatrist and how often. i told him. he asked about the meds im on. and he asked if im feeling better multiple times. lots of “beta” and “dikra.” i didnt know what to do. it felt like it should be a big deal—something to cry about. he just called me now, a few hours later, and asked what i was doing. again, lots of caring words. i was confused about why he was calling so much. he said that mummy told him i get scared when he calls and he doesnt want that to happen anymore. he said “don’t be scared of me dear. im just calling to check on you. i wont say anything.” (in gujarati). im touched. im trying to feel safe.  </p>
    <p> can i have a white russian with oat milk please? </p>
    <p> i love circular UI </p>
    <p> desire for rigidity and certainty when i have a fluid personality </p>
    <p> authenticity and performance are not mutually exclusive. perhaps performance is human nature? </p>
    <p> in capturing my life, i remove myself from it. i attend to the content captured. how does this change the state of the self? the authentic self?  </p>
    <p> one year ago i wished for a passion. today i wished for the ability to carry out my passion. </p>
    <p> posting makes me anxious </p>
    <p> noticing more autonomy over my thoughts - less echo chambers - memories are mostly of time spent with friends instead of stuff i saw online (didn’t even realize this was a thing before)  </p>
    <p> technology has enabled people to be more vicious and violent. not seeing the effects of your actions. cancel culture. arguing. useless range and complaining that is exacerbated by algorithms that value negative speech. </p>
    <p> ethical hackers 😎😎😎 </p>
    <p> - put gems on his face - what’s ur go-to dance move? stank face. - came back. sat on the couch. he said im very philosophical  - cig kiss - made me try on glasses. u look good. - u are cool. repeatedly.  - u look good in green and black too. what’s ur color? red. yeah u look good. - u can sing. - have u ever been in love? what do u love? - wants someone to ask him as many questions as he asks people - drives safely - earth sign energy. empath. - doesn’t feel anger. gets frustrated when he says hi and ppl don’t say it back - wish u could see the way ppl saw u. smooth talker. cool. “ur just describing urself” - thinks a lot about school - likes bollywood movie about W hidden treasure. what was the name again? - watches modern family - u have rly good style. no YOU have rly good style. women just blow it out of the park. </p>
    <p> today we watched my old video star MVs. and part of me wanted to cry. my friends were cheering on baby tulsi and my inner child needed to hear that. to hear how much people love her. to feel worth it. i’ve noticed that i’ve always seen love and friendship as something i need to work for. people can’t like me for me. i must buy them things, make them happy, put them first. maybe they’ll like me then. even watching videos of me in middle school… i can’t believe i thought i was fat. my dysmorphia was worse than i thought. i’ve always been such an insecure person. and while i‘be gained confidence, the anxiety remains. it manifests as wanting to be loved before loving. not being able to like anyone without noticing flaws. fear of intimacy. sigh.  </p>
    <p> the future arrives to us. time is only the present. we are only the present. fixed. </p>
    <p> erti thought gunpoint was a place. “just don’t go there” </p>
    <p> gabrielle and i are playing thumb war and i’m having so much fun #manic </p>
    <p> ihea downloaded the flo app bc he thought that’s what boyfriends do 😭💀💀 </p>
    <p> libgen.rus </p>
    <p> thinking about the power of platonic love </p>
    <p> sarah is whining and writhing in her chair because she doesn’t want to do a bio bc it’s very american and self indulgent. she’s afraid that ppl will think this is offensive but it’s really just a cultural difference that she’s rightfully uncomfortable with.  </p>
    <p> teddys parents are techno libertarian survivalists  </p>
    <p> zeus is old navy </p>
    <p> ihea just said that it makes a lot of sense that i was the suspect for a bomb threat.  </p>

    <p> i need to be active. i am not a quiet person and not meant for quietness.  </p>
    <p> shreya’s are the nursing majors of south asia </p>
    <p> today megan and i completed our bushwick transformation by sitting in the park while reading Murakami and smoking cbd cigs. i also have dyed hair now and she has two new piercings lmaoo. </p>
    <p> your proximity to men is not liberation. making money, being independent, being a girlboss is draining. you’re just emulating men and still living to their standards </p>
    <p> omg i literally just finished and recited a whole theory of everything and like i literally figured out the universe like everything is the same photon but i forgot everything! i found the answer to the universe and then forgot it!!!!!  </p>
    <p> i am understanding the burping process with such depth. i’m bloated and have been pushing an air bubble down to my chest and pack up to my throat for like an HOUR. feeling like u need to burp but not burping for an hour while ur high is actually insane. but anyways it has made me really attentive to the sensation of air bubbles moving through your chest. what a beautiful process. burping. </p>
    <p> you sneak in bad thoughts about yourself more than you think. since time perception is different for me, i’m perceiving more events in detail per second. i’m observing your thoughts and you seem to condescend urself quite often. you don’t even realize it. so really, be gentle with yourself. <3 </p>
    <p> i want to relate to love songs in that i want to experience that depth of heartbreak. the pain of having a nice drag across your chest at the sight or memory of someone. to have all memories between you be like slo motion flashbacks in movies. idk </p>
    <p> megan said she “feels so much peace and kinship with me when we make little noises together” ^-^ *~ </p>
    <p> don’t seek to escape the darkness, learn to love yourself there </p>
    <p> why does the heart shape symbolize love? where did it come from? </p>
    <p> kya khub rab ne kiya. bin maange itna kiya. </p>
    <p> hai bhagavan, bada nu kaliyaan kar jo </p>
    <p> do NOT un-align from yourself for ANYONE. love yourself first.  </p>
    <p> wind going through tree leaves sounds like very soft rain  </p>
    <p> spiritually i am a hoe but physically, i am ugly </p>
    <p> art about holding your attachment at a distance. so u can let it go. if it’s inside you and it disappears, it leaves u feeling empty  </p>
    <p> in the moment between sunset and night, the brief period of an indescribable opal sky </p>
    <p> we need to let go of things in order to receive better things  </p>
    <p> when the sunsets and the trees turn into black silhouettes, allowing u to see every crisp outline of their leaves - maybe the creator made earth green so that we could always be working on our heart chakra— always learning to love more </p>
    <p> my shadow passed by me by the car light  </p>
    <p> humans could’ve just stopped at small societies and hunter gatherer lifestyle but noooo we had to keep progressing and build empires and whatever tf venture capital is. we live at in a physics 3d reality but spend most of our time in a 3x5in portal that takes us to a digital dimension bro what </p>
    <p> sometimes i just want to take my mind and shove it into someone’s heart </p>
    <p> - poetry is such a time-sensitive way to package emotional catharsis. i was reading some of my old poems and i don’t even understand what my own self meant. yet that poem holds so much emotion which i can only access if i go back in time to the moment i wrote it. </p>
    <p> today i made an analogy between eileens relationship and a guy named bob eating desserts  </p>
    <p> nothing belongs to me - free yourself from attachment, only then can you be filled with other thing - allow everything to come and go - love someone and send them away with love </p>
    <p> i think i’m in love. no object. just love 🤍 </p>
    <p> smiling with so much genuine joy and appreciation lately that i can see the kindness starting to get etched on my face. </p>
    <p> hate is just negative love
    still love tho
    experimenting w this framework
    hate and love are just two seemingly separate/opposite features of the same reality
    just food for thought
    what makes us hate and what makes us love?
    we hate for a cause
    we love for a cause
    do we hate something bc we don’t love it?
    do we love something bc we don’t hate it?
    sometimes we both love and hate something </p>
    <p> instagram option to make certain posts public  </p>
    <p> how much can i tolerate being misunderstood/ misperceived/  assumed about? </p>
    <p> i be writing poems just to not remember what my own self meant a few months later  </p>
    <p> im full of love in the sense that it’s the absence of hatred </p>
    <p> spell of the sensuous </p>
    <p> in the end there may not be a grand epiphany. in the end you come back to the same quotes you’ve heard all along. these repetitive, familiar quotes that were repeated so often that they seemed to lose meaning, end up being the truest words when they apply to your story  </p>
    <p> art doesn’t have to be relatable </p>
    <p> linguistic translation chain </p>
    <p> it’s much easier to be sad/ sit in sadness than spend so much energy chasing a faraway optimism/ hope </p>
    <p> bianca’s weakness: poke in ribs </p>
    <p> music heals animals heal time heals. things are more beautiful under blue light </p>
    <p> today felt so complete (nov 30 2020) </p>
    <p> kindness etched onto someone’s face </p>
    <p> today i pained in a way i had never imagined before.
    the painting signified satisfaction. safety.
    a silenced hunger. a mother’s love. 
    i looked down at my plate.
    the remnants of my shak swirled out like the brush strokes of a painting.
    i traced the patterns left behind by my roti as it swept up the food.
    patterns indicating an infinite appetite finally ceased. 
    as i cleaned my plate, i stained my fingers turmeric.
    i washed away my painting and along with it, my hunger.  </p>
    <p> How great would it be if we lived in a world where you put in “1” and get “1”
    - if you think about it we get much more </p>

    <p> i want to do just the right amount of thinking
    books are like trampoline, reflections— mind bounces off a line like light does off a mirror
    wish i had clear eyesight </p>
    <p> kafkaesque</p>
    <p>i love bliblies. and glep  </p>
    <p>blue is infinity </p>
    <p>i am a victim of surveillance. i desired to be watched.  </p>
    <p>crypto-anarchists and the sybil problem </p>
    <p>constructing an online self as a way of ACTUALIZING oneself. a philosopher talked abt it in the blade runner philosophy video</p>
    <p>spacetypegenerator tool</p>
    <p>constant longing for connection. to be interlinked. </p>
    <p>language allowed us to construct a symbolic self</p>
